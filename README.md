# Brain AVM Classification Project

## Dataset

### Dataset Details
This dataset contains 7084 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 2 classes:
- avm
- non-avm

### Data Pre-processing
After splitting them into train-val-test datasets with 70-20-10 ratio, we had 
- 4958 for training 
- 1418 for validation
- 708 for testing

### Augmentation
Augmentation was needed to improve our accuracy.
We used rotation, horizontal and vertical flip, brigthness change, shear, zooming as techniques.
